<h1>Virality</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In my first year of university, I made a social networking app named Virality. I mostly used PHP, MySQL, and C#. Even though it wasn't perfect, it was a lot of fun to make because it was something I had never done before and I wanted to challenge myself. Both the admin and user sides are present. The PDF provides a detailed account of my software methodology process.
